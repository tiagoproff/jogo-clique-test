# Click Game (Test Project)

A simple and interactive HTML5 test project designed for the **Firefox OS**, a legacy mobile operating system. Click to increase your score and see a dynamic visual effect of text growing and fading. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this is an initial experiment hosted on GitHub Pages, optimized for older devices like the LG Fireweb. This is just the beginning—stay tuned for a full **zombie survival game** in the future!

## Why Firefox OS?

This project is a proof-of-concept targeting the **Firefox OS**, a discontinued open-source platform by Mozilla. It tests how lightweight web technologies perform on legacy hardware, like the LG Fireweb (2013). It’s a stepping stone toward a bigger goal: creating a complete zombie survival game for retro and modern platforms alike.
